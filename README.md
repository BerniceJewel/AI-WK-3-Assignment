AI Tools: AI Tools and Applications
Theme: "Mastering the AI Toolkit" 🛠️🧠

Objective & Guidelines
Evaluate your understanding of AI tools/frameworks and their real-world applications through a mix of theoretical and practical tasks.
You’ll demonstrate proficiency in selecting, implementing, and critically analyzing AI tools to solve problems.

There are three parts: theory, which tests the theoretical understanding of AI Tools; 
Practical, which tests the implementation skills of AI tools; and 
Ethics and optimization, which tests ethical AI development and AI software optimization skills. 

Should be handled as group work formed. This is to enhance teamwork and AI engineering collaboration.
